Start with some questions

How many of you do Operation job? Means deploying and maintaining  your code in pre prod and prod env
Do yo think, it is stressful and time consuming?

There are other problems of today operation jobs

1) It require lot of training of new technologies and expertised. If you are a new to team, you don't want to do production deployment for
atleast first 3 months..
2) There is always a chances of error due to human interaction.
3) Maintaining multiple scripts..
4) It is passive and DevOps engineer have to go and do or look for information.

We vision a world, where a new team member can do production deployment from second day without any error and any stress.
It is like having a chat about your favourite sport with your close buddy over coffee .

Second team member:
How this world looks like.. Let me give a glimpse of it.. We have build a Alexa based application, which can deploy and
report server load metrics without typing a single line of code and sweating over it..

 Demo



Third member:
Thanks you..Wow!! That's was great.. Do you guys like it?
I am sure most of you liked it and would like to adopt it from tomorrow to make your life easy and have more
time to write code than worrying about deployment..and maintaining system

There are endless possibilities with it

 Think a world where conventional UI ( Alexa or Bot) will alert you  current server/memory load and advice to to reduce or increase the server
 capacity Inform you about current problem and suggest corrective action.. Send you a message on Slack, WhatsApp about
 current server health and what is the next logical step to perform
